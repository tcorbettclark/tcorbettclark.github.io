# README

My personal website.

# TODO - content

- Write up my Apple notes.
- On intellectual side:
  - Puzzles - recreational, bite-sized
  - Investigations - more specialist, deeper and more extensive write-up trying to answer "why". For example, logarithms, or complex numbers.
  - Experiments - code e.g complexity.
  - Research projects - programmes of work. Largest sized. Could reference investigations.
- My productivity tools
  - cloud and locally installed software
- My computer setup
  - Low level, Rectangle, RayCast
  - Keyboard mapping
  - fastfetch output
  - Ref github repo
- Create a now page. See https://nownownow.com/about
- Find a link to the PDF for my "Choosing an appropriate model for novelty detection" paper.
  - Perhaps? https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/607503
- Look for other content ideas from:
  - https://bastian.rieck.me
  - https://theoryandpractice.org

# TODO - technical

- Allow merging lists across TOML files, e.g. to better manage sitemap files.
  And inject a special variable into the TOML for the current directory to make relocatable.
- Some kind of floating and automatic TOC on all main pages. And document on approach page.
- Find way to allow editor (Zed) find the virtualenv magically created by uv when running script
- Decide on all markdown plugins.
- Find a way to deliver a 404 on the dev server (currently just returns empty files!).
- Submit sitemap to search engines (once?).
- Fontawesome:
  - Find an alternative. Maybe.
  - I'm using the free plan which has a monthly limit of 10,000 views.
  - Login to fontawesome.com to see usage.
- Reduce (stop?) Fontawesome (or any rendering flicker of icon fonts, however made).
- Keep an eye on how well the pages print to PDF, e.g. my CV page. Currently pretty good!
  - Perhaps hide the breadcrumb navigation?
- Look into Social Media meta tags: https://css-tricks.com/essential-meta-tags-social-media/
- Switch this list into github issues, with milestone planning, ready for merging workflow, etc.
