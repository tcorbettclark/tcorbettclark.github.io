# README

My personal website.

# TODO - content

- Create a now page. See https://nownownow.com/about
- Find a link to the PDF for my "Choosing an appropriate model for novelty detection" paper.
  - Perhaps? https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/607503
- Create My computer setup page, include software setup, configuration (link to github), and fastfetch output
- Create My tools of choice page
- Look for other content ideas from:
  - https://bastian.rieck.me
  - https://theoryandpractice.org

# TODO - technical

- Some kind of floating TOC on main pages
- Use the breadcrumb Bulma component and make it easier to maintain (e.g. with my-website).
- Find way to allow editor (Zed) find the virtualenv magically created by uv when running script
- Add light/dark mode switcher (take from Bulma website)
- Fix colour issues in dark mode - poor contrast.
- Decide on all markdown plugins.
- Find a way to deliver a 404 on the dev server (currently just returns empty files!).
- Submit sitemap to search engines (once?).
- Fontawesome:
  - Find an alternative. Maybe.
  - I'm using the free plan which has a monthly limit of 10,000 views.
  - Login to fontawesome.com to see usage.
- Reduce (stop?) Fontawesome (or any rendering flicker of icon fonts, however made).
- Keep an eye on how well the pages print to PDF, e.g. my CV page. Currently pretty good!
  - Perhaps hide the breadcrumb navigation?
- Look into Social Media meta tags: https://css-tricks.com/essential-meta-tags-social-media/
- Switch this list into github issues, with milestone planning, ready for merging workflow, etc.
