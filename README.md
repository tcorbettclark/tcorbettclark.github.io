# TODO - content

- Write up my Apple notes.
- On intellectual side:
  - Puzzles - recreational, bite-sized
  - Investigations - more specialist, deeper and more extensive write-up trying to answer "why". For example, logarithms, or complex numbers.
  - Experiments - code e.g complexity.
  - Research projects - programmes of work. Largest sized. Could reference investigations.
- My productivity tools
  - cloud and locally installed software
- My computer setup
  - Low level, Rectangle, RayCast
  - Keyboard mapping
  - fastfetch output
  - Ref github repo
- Create a now page. See https://nownownow.com/about
- Find a link to the PDF for my "Choosing an appropriate model for novelty detection" paper.
  - Perhaps? https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/607503
- Look for other content ideas from:
  - https://bastian.rieck.me
  - https://theoryandpractice.org

# TODO technical site

- Navigation
  - Some kind of floating and automatic TOC on all main pages. And document on approach page.
  - Make header tags linkable
  - Provide fast return to top, and/or keep navigation bar always visible
- me.css has SRI, but not listed in the CSP. Fortunately doesn't matter, but the base template should support extensions.
- Reduce font size of h2 (especially poor on phone).
- Keep an eye on how well the pages print to PDF, e.g. my CV page. Currently pretty good!
  - Perhaps hide the breadcrumb navigation?

# TODO - technical awg

- Separate (and colour) the output e.g. into Builder, Server, Watcher categories. But maybe more.
- DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH is only correct for me because I installed brew in /usr/local. The default is /opt/...
- Decide on all markdown plugins.
- Allow merging lists across TOML files, e.g. to better manage sitemap files.
- Find a way to deliver a 404 on the dev server (currently just returns empty files!).

# TODO - other

- Switch this list into github issues, with milestone planning, ready for merging workflow, etc.
- Look into Social Media meta tags: https://css-tricks.com/essential-meta-tags-social-media/
- Submit sitemap to various search engines (once?).
