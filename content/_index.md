The purpose of this website is to encourage me to write and think clearly. Whether anyone reads it is secondary, although naturally I hope that it may be of some interest. The website is also a presentation of who I am.

It is not a blog. Blogs are a chronological record of output. Given the purpose of this site, I think it is better for the author (i.e. me) to take responsibility for the assembly and navigation of cohesive thought, improving and modifying as needed over time.
