I enjoy mathematical nuggets and puzzles, e.g. from:
[@mathisstillfun](https://x.com/mathisstillfun),
[@mathssolutionz](https://x.com/mathssolutionz),
[Mirangu](https://mirangu.com). They are an invitation to explore.

Here are some of the more interesting, surprising, and/or fun. My answers with discussion and extensions are written up as PDFs.

* [Problem 1](problem-1/index.html) - sum of squared distances from polygon corners to enclosed circle
* [Problem 2](problem-2/index.html) - an invariant expression for all roots of unity
* [Problem 3](problem-3/index.html) - a power bound on factorial
