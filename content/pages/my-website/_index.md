# My website

This website is built using a hand-crafted static site generator. Yes, another one - see [this list](https://jamstack.org/generators/) for example. My justification for "reinventing the wheel" is that:

- I personally enjoy the deeper understanding which comes from creation;
- I want full control to make the result clean and right at both the human and technical level;
- I only want a small number of the features possible in a static site;
- **In my experience of other static site generation tools over the years, I found an uneven and arbitrary (personal?) interface between the tool and the content, and always had to work and think on both sides. This suggests to me that the boundary should either be abandoned entirely or moved substantially.**

I've chosen to move the boundary, and hence see:

- [my twg tool](twg.html) to understand what it does (and does not) do in general, and how it works;
- [web content](content.html) for a systematic walk-through of my choice of web framework, libraries, generating the sitemap, notes to achieve colour consistency, publishing on GitHub pages, checking and achieving validity and reasonable security, _etc_.
