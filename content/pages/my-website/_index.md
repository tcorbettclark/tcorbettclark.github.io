# My website

## Purpose

The purpose of this website is to encourage me to write and think clearly. Whether anyone reads it is secondary, although naturally I hope that it may be of some interest. The website is also a presentation of who I am.

It is not a blog. Blogs are a chronological record of output. Given the purpose of this site, I think it is better for the author (i.e. me) to take responsibility for the assembly and navigation of cohesive thought, improving and modifying as needed over time.

## Technical overview

This website is built using a hand-crafted static site generator. Yes, another one - see [this list](https://jamstack.org/generators/) for example. My justification for "reinventing the wheel" is that:

- I personally enjoy the deeper understanding which comes from creation;
- I want full control to make the result clean and right at both the human and technical level;
- I only want a small number of the features possible in a static site;
- In my experience of other static site generation tools over the years, I found an uneven and arbitrary (personal?) interface between the tool and the content, and always had to work and think on both sides. This suggests to me that the boundary should either be abandoned entirely or moved substantially.

I've chosen to move the boundary substantially, and hence:

- See my [twg tool](twg.html) to understand what it does (and does not) do in general; and how it works.
- Then [web content](content.html) describes my choice of web framework, libraries, sitemap generation, colour consistency, publishing on GitHub pages, checking and achieving validity and decent security, _etc_.
