The purpose of this website is to encourage me to write and think clearly, to share things I find interesting, and to present who I am. This isn't a blog; it's a living space of content where I am continually adding, refining, and refactoring as needed.

As a technical person, I like to Create, Think, Research, and Learn, giving rise to the handy acronym, CTRL. I find it helpful to be aware of these 4 activity modes at every scale - from playing with tiny puzzles and problems, investigating random ideas, working on personal or commercial projects, and thinking about topics I have found interesting over many years.

Achieving genuine originality is unimportant and unlikely, but it needs to be original to me and synthesised with clarity. The factors I value most are:

- Academic *rigorous* understanding, evaluated honestly through creating and writing.
- Deliverable *output* (results, algorithms, code, tools, visualisations, tutorials, teaching papers, ...).
- Enlightening, persuasive, and refined *intuition*.
- Overarching connecting *themes*.

I also remain alert for commercial opportunities.

Publishing in this medium is a new initiative. So far I have documented [my computer setup](../my-setup/index.html), published some solutions to recreational [mathematic puzzles](../recreational-maths/index.html), and explained how I made [this website](../building-this-website/index.html).
