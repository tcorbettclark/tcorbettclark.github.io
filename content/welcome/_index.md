# About

The purpose of this website is to encourage me to write and think clearly, to share things I find interesting and hope will be of interest to others, and to be a presentation of who I am.

It is not a blog, i.e. it is not a collection of articles accumulating over time. Instead, I take responsibility for the assembly and navigation of cohesive content, making new additions, improving existing, and refactoring when needed.
