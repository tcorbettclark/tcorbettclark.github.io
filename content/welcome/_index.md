The purpose of this site is to encourage me to write.
This isn't a blog; it's a living space of considered content where I add, refine, and refactor as needed.

As a technical person, I have found it productive to spend quality time on 4 distinct activity modes.
Deliberately switching between Creating, Thinking, Researching, and Learning (CTRL) helps to make progress at every scale - from playing with tiny puzzles and problems, investigating ad hoc ideas, working on personal or commercial projects, to developing long-standing interests.

Deep originality is neither a primary goal nor a likely outcome, but it must be original to me and synthesised with clarity.
The factors I value most are:

- **Rigorous understanding**: Validated by writing full explanations, addressing the "why" as much as the "what".
- **Tangible output**: Experimental results, algorithms, code, tools, visualisations, papers, etc.
- **Refined intuition**: Distilled, enlightening, and persuasive insights.
- **Overarching themes**: Linking diverse topics to generate new tools, techniques, and understanding.

I have reached a stage in my life where commercial activity is less important than intellectual stimulation.
Nevertheless, I remain alert to interesting venture opportunities where my experiences and skills could have value.

Publishing in this form is a new endeavor.
I am working my way through a backlog of notes compiled over decades, finding my voice by writing up some solutions to recreational [maths problems](../maths-problems/index.html), documenting [my computer setup](../my-setup/index.html), and explaining the building and maintaining of [this website](../building-this-website/index.html).


I have also written up my latest thoughts on improving [my skiing](../skiing/index.html).
