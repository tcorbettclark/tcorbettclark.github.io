# About

The purpose of this website is to encourage me to write and think clearly, to share things I find interesting and hope might be of interest to others, and as a presentation of who I am.

It is not a blog. Blogs are a chronological record of output. Given the purpose of this site, I take responsibility for the assembly and navigation of cohesive thought, improving and modifying as needed over time.
