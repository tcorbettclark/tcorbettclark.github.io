The purpose of this website is to encourage me to write and think clearly, to share things I find interesting, and to present who I am. This isn't a blog; it's a living space of content where I am continually adding, refining, and refactoring as needed.

As a technical person, I find it useful to think CTRL: Create, Think, Research, and Learn. Rotating around these 4 activity modes helps progress at every scale - from playing with tiny puzzles and problems, investigating ad hoc ideas, developing personal or commercial projects, and thinking about long-standing interests.

While geniune originality is neither my primary goal nor a likely outcome, it's crucial that the content is original to me and synthesised with clarity. The factors I value most are:

- **Rigorous academic understanding**: Validated using written explanations, addressing the "why" as much as the "what".
- **Tangible output**: Experimental results, algorithms, code, tools, visualisations, papers, etc.
- **Refined intuition**: Distilled, enlightening, and persuasive insights.
- **Overarching connecting themes**: Linking seemingly diverse topics to generate new tools, techniques, and understanding.

I remain alert for possible commercial opportunities.

Publishing in this form is a new endeavor. I am working my way through a backlog of notes compiled over decades. To date, I have written up some solutions to recreational [maths problems](../maths-problems/index.html), documented [my computer setup](../my-setup/index.html), and explained the building and maintaining of [this website](../building-this-website/index.html).
