# Editor and Terminal

Zed

Not iterm2 any more, because never used all the features, but alacritty.org
Often just use the terminal built into Zed (which is alacritty)
See .alacritty.toml

# Keyboard

- ⌥ is Option/Alt
- ⌘ is Command/Cmd
- 🌐︎ is Fn/Globe

Use Karabiner-eventviewer to watch events
Also https://keycode.info/

I have configured using Karabiner to make

- The Windows button into Command/Cmd (was Option/Alt)
- The Alt button into Option/Alt (was Command/Cmd)
- The Application button into (right) option.
- (The Fn key does nothing)

So the modifier buttons are now:

Ctrl ⌥ ⌘ \<space\> ⌘ Fn ⌥ Ctrl

And make sure keyboard is set to British, and not to Unicode Hex Input!
