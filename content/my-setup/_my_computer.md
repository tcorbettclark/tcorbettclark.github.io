# Editor and Terminal

Zed

Not iterm2 any more, because never used all the features, but alacritty.org
Often just use the terminal built into Zed (which is alacritty)
See .alacritty.toml

Check fish_delta

TODO explain where I installed brew (and find out if that was actually a good idea!)

brew install lsd
alias la 'ls -a'
alias ll 'ls -l'
alias lla 'ls -la'
alias ls lsd
alias lt 'ls --tree'

# Odds

[AutoRaise application](https://github.com/sbmpost/AutoRaise)

# Keyboard

- ‚å• is Option/Alt
- ‚åò is Command/Cmd
- üåêÔ∏é is Fn/Globe

Use Karabiner-eventviewer to watch events
Also https://keycode.info/

I have configured using Karabiner to make

- The Windows button into Command/Cmd (was Option/Alt)
- The Alt button into Option/Alt (was Command/Cmd)
- The Application button into (right) option.
- (The Fn key does nothing)

So the modifier buttons are now:

Ctrl ‚å• ‚åò \<space\> ‚åò Fn ‚å• Ctrl

And make sure keyboard is set to British, and not to Unicode Hex Input!

# Shell

bat - syntax aware cat
eza - (instead of lsd) for smarter ls
dust - better du to understand disk usage
bottom (btm) - better top
