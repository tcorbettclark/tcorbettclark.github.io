I only started skiing in my mid 30s, which is probably too late to build any real intuition due to fear of injury (and long recovery times).
Here are my latest thoughts and links on how I am trying to improve.

# Overall

1. Ski with (personal) style. Play with gravity. Be athletic, dynamic, and carry the energy. See [YouTube](https://youtu.be/-uKnYj_vhgg?si=HfFOSSOgC9l1QyCC).
1. On steeps, think of the slope as the horizon and “down” as orthogonal to the slope. Look to centre of curvature, especially for wider radius turns.
1. Consciously adjust the width of stance (wider for carving and narrower for short turns/moguls). Think of it as one of the control channels.
1. Avoid unnecessary movement. Make smooth, progressive, economic, balanced, and committed movements.

# Drills - for Short Turns

1. Roll ankles before reaching the fall line to engage edges and grip earlier. See [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vkEM0KUElk).
1. Short turns from snowplow. Edge lock. Hips on the inside. See [YouTube](https://youtu.be/o8oDVHT1kws?si=CINdja8W-op1pP0G).
1. 5 short turn drills. See [YouTube](https://youtu.be/NzyaqhzvrI4?si=HhvaQQUGcf3-VJro).
1. Linked “hockey slows” - a 90% "hockey stop" with 2 pole plants and little hip rotation (only legs), leading with ankle and knee. Then reduce to 80% off, 70% off, etc. See [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGznuGbSeSs).
1. One leg ski traverse release / garlands. See [YouTube](https://youtu.be/C6BGdf-2J00?si=Xs3vFBd0ejuPx5hH).

# Drills - for Carving

1. Slow bend and stretch on every turn, so changing edges in a low position. See [YouTube](https://youtube.com/shorts/1dmiRfvmSlI?si=10rHO-TWKAUbtgJl).
1. Flexed through edge change. Extend only when edges engaged. See [YouTube](https://youtube.com/shorts/qGFYI-0UK6A?si=zCfD3MLX9aFmyXZN).
1. Double edge pressure ski. See [YouTube](https://youtube.com/shorts/7D20Ws4_88k?si=yl-xJPB_NIZJqbU9).
1. Javelin / stork turns. Transfer weight before switching edge. See [YouTube](https://youtu.be/VO-zVbD-RZs?si=OeC-T0r-catO387W).
1. One legged turns. See [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzyaqhzvrI4&t=424s).
1. In-rigger leg. Wide stance. Feel early toppling and getting low with safety of stabilisers. Flat stabiliser ski. Progressive edging through the turn. Only move the stabiliser ski by shortening that inside leg. Don’t twist either ski, but especially not the active one. The edge does all the turning. See [YouTube](https://youtu.be/iK4ECXkwqMY?si=pO4dRLiD_hPdq0mv).
1. Skate turn with maintained contact. See [YouTube](https://youtube.com/shorts/O8smJ7EIF5I?si=9nqwJJwOE2-D5tUd).
1. White pass turns. See [YouTube](https://youtu.be/C-94kbKGbtU?si=MBuFRrzlxo3GcdaN).

# Drills - General

1. Drill bounce on the tip of the boot, flexing the ankles.
1. Jump up and down on traverse. The landing position should be most stable overall posture.
1. Practice staying too far forward; practice staying too far back; then practice Goldilocks!
1. When stationary, lift one ski, see how it hangs naturally and what's required to bring it parallel. Then do same but with skis on edge. Use this to work out muscles needed to keep inside ski parallel and engaged fully.
1. Hold poles firmly, at arms length in front, always in contact with snow. Encourages constant forward weight/pressure.
1. Garland pivot exercises to align edge engagement between feet and start the turn by rolling the ankles.
    * Start with a traverse: Ski across the hill on a gentle slope, keeping a light edge to hold the traverse. Ski’s further apart!
    * Release the edge: Roll your ankles and rotate knees away from the slope to flatten the skis. This should be a small movement.
    * Let the skis drift into an arc: As the skis flatten, they will automatically point slightly downhill and make the top of a turn.
    * Reengage the edge: Roll the ankles and knees back into the slope to bring the skis across the hill again.
    * Repeat: Release → small arc → reengage.

# On Flex and Extension

Suspension and much of the control of the pressure/edge comes from the coiling and uncoiling of the whole body.

1. All three joints should be relaxed and flexible - ankles, knees, hips.
1. Be loose. Don’t block any particular movement. Always able to move up, down, left, right.
1. Always movement; always dynamic.
1. Flex in the transition. Only extend once the skis have engaged. Then flex again to release. Flex starting from the knees (“toilet position”), not just the waist.

# On Body Position and Balance

Continuing on from flex and extension...

1. Be centred, kneel forward, with forward hips.
1. Stable upper body. No unnecessary movement. Posture reset.
1. Balance (perpendicular) against the slope, not against gravity (vertical). This is dynamic balance in motion.
1. Note the Virtual Bump - the change in steepness due to the turn (so in first half of turn the slope becomes steeper, and second half it becomes less steep). To stay perpendicular in an athletic stance, move forward (or retract skis) in first half, and then reverse that movement in second half. This is a *separate* reason to applying this movement to engage the tips. See [YouTube](https://youtu.be/O8CmZ5spZq0?si=s4PG67w53BqFJpBH).
1. Don’t stick bottom out.
1. Don't sit down.
1. Don’t lean forward too much.
1. Don’t have too much pressure on shins throughout as it restricts release movement.

# On Arms, Hands, and Poles

And the arms, hands, and poles all play a key part in balance and control.

1. Hands forward and in an athletic position.
1. Arms wider and bent at the elbow.
1. Hands should be in the bottom two corners of the “TV”.
1. Arms and shoulders relaxed and actively helping balance.
1. Pole plant, if any, should be small and from the wrist. Use a calm and optimised position. No shoulder movement. Don't let the pole plant knock the body out of balance.
1. Hold the points of the sticks outwards like a hovercraft, with palms down and held consistent height. Feel slow to make rounded short turns.

# On Carving Turns

1. Transition weight release by lifting legs up. Ski under. Don’t just pull skis back, or just lean forward, but do both. Pivot about your centre to become perpendicular.
1. Relax and flex ankles, knees, and hips. Don’t turn with ankles, but flex and roll the ankles. The edge change starts with the ankles. Feel your feet. Roll over to other edges, without pushing off from old downhill ski. Simultaneous edge change. See YouTube.
1. Flatten skis with edge release on steeper slopes. Practice with controlled start/stop pivot slips. Higher edges on steeps puts too much weight on the inside ski! No “over-edging”. Don’t “push” or “stand up” on the new uphill ski, but release the old downhill ski. Stay low and be efficient.
1. Femur rotation and ankle rotation (foot side). See YouTube.
1. Retraction extension turns. Turn when low, tip to other edge, engage new edges, and THEN extend. So NOT standing to initiate the turn, but “standing” (extending) to drive the edge round the turn. Start all low. Then add extension. Also practice extension traversal - lift up and move down the downhill ski and let it rise back up to connect. Can also do all low drill with a non carve turn (harder). No pole plant - just balance hands. See YouTube.
1. Heel Heavy Transition. Knees go back at start and come forward as reach the next transition.
1. Early edge is different from early pressure. Aim for early edge and allow pressure to follow slowly.
1. Roll ankles before you reach the fall line to engage edges earlier.
1. Think of tip of ski as your own toe, and engage it in the snow at start of turn. Do this by moving hips forward and pulling skis back. It’s only a small movement!
1. Centred stance throughout turn. Stay over your feet. Aim upper body for apex of turn. And apply pressure on balls of feet.
1. Gradual, not sudden.
1. Look ahead, at least as far as the apex. Don't look at where you are going to turn as it causes zigzag.
1. Where you look should be independent of where your skis point, shoulders indicate, etc.
1. Start next turn before the previous is finished. Release at the apex!
1. First turn is hardest, so only do one!
1. Early weight transfer. Much earlier. Relax downhill ski to take off weight, but still with simultaneous edge release.
1. Don’t rush any part because always changing, so no need to catch up the movement!
1. S shape is all turning.
1. Breathe!
1. Slow down to turn; don’t turn to slow down. So be at the right speed for each turn. If necessary, break at the end of the turn (never the start).
1. Always move with flow.
1. Modern carving skis steer from the tips and the tails.
1. Early edging means inside ski angle acceleration.
1. Don’t turn the skis but leave them pointing as for transition for longer. Maintain contact.
1. Change from one edge to the other before changing direction.
1. Simultaneous release.
1. Release pressure earlier to enable topple. Stay low and don’t stand for too long on downhill ski.

# Describing the Two Types of Turn

Identifying the type of turn helps prevent advice from appearing contradictory.

1. Short turns have greater separation of upper and lower body, putting tension in the body to help initiate the next turn. Skis are closer together. It starts with the legs. You turn the skis.
1. Long carving turns have greater alignment of upper and lower body, with a slower transition movement. Skis are shoulder-width apart. It starts with the ankles. The skis turn you.
