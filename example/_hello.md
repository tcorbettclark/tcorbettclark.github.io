## Markdown content

The Markdown parser is configured with extras, including:

- Smart "quotes" and replacement (e.g. to produce (c))
- Maths e.g. $\sin(x)^2+\cos(x)^2=1$ (escaped and tagged but not rendered without javascript mathjax or katex etc)
- HTML fallback, e.g. <i>This is actually in italics</i>
- What else?
